    "Like many U.S. cities, Chicago is working to provide as many COVID-19 vaccines as possible to its residents. As of 3/24/2021,\n",
    "only 24% of city residents have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (1), and 12% of residents have received a complete\n",
    "set of doses of a vaccine. As eligibility requirements are relaxed, and as supply struggles to meet demand, city health officials\n",
    "will be interested in finding ways to make vaccinations as easy and as widely available as possible, especially those that it\n",
    "has identified as being uniquely vulnerable to infection, such as poor and minority communities (2). Besides state-run sites,\n",
    "venues such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and medical centers will serve as local distribution sites that will administer doses\n",
    "to city residents. This project will seek to compare neighborhoods across Chicago based on the number of grocery stores,\n",
    "pharmacies, and medical centers and identify any similarities or differences between neighborhoods. Based on this comparison,\n",
    "this project will remark on any areas of the city that have relatively few venues where vaccines are likely to be obtained."
